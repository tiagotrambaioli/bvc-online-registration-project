Project backend for the course SODV2201 - Web Programming at Bow Valley College, Calgary, Canada.

It is a system for students to register for programs and courses, send questions and consult courses. Administrators can create, update or delete programs and courses, verify students, read and update status of inquiry forms.

The database is local in .json files, and was built using the puppeteer library to collect data from the official website.
The script can be viewed at https://github.com/tiagotrambaioli/BVCScraping

In the future I plan to upgrade to mongodb or sql in order to learn more.

Tiago =)
